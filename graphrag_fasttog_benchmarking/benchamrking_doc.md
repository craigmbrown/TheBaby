# Comparison of GraphRAG and FastToG for Knowledge Graph RAG

## 1. Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Knowledge Graphs (KG-RAG) enhances language models by integrating structured knowledge into response generation. Two notable approaches are:

- **GraphRAG (Your Implementation)**: A pipeline that translates natural language queries into Cypher queries for Neo4j, executes them, and retrieves structured results along with vector similarity search.
- **Fast Think-on-Graph (FastToG)**: A novel method that improves graph-based reasoning by leveraging community detection, pruning, and text conversion to facilitate LLM interpretation.

### **Experimentation Environment**
The testing and benchmarking of **FastToG** and **GraphRAG** were conducted in the following **notebook environment**:

## 2. High-Level Differences

### **GraphRAG Approach**

GraphRAG is a **direct querying method** that generates Cypher queries from user questions and executes them in **Neo4j**, retrieving structured results. It integrates **vector search** for similarity-based retrieval and relies on LLMs to refine and interpret results.

#### **Key Features**

- **Cypher Query Generation:** Converts natural language questions into Cypher queries using an LLM.
- **Validation & Correction:** Detects syntax errors in queries and corrects them automatically.
- **Structured Query Execution:** Runs validated Cypher queries on Neo4j and retrieves database records.
- **Vector Similarity Search:** Retrieves additional relevant information based on vector embeddings.
- **LLM-Based Answer Generation:** Combines structured query results and vector search outputs to generate final answers.
- **Step-by-Step Execution:** Modular pipeline with discrete steps for query generation, validation, execution, similarity retrieval, and final response.

### **FastToG Approach**

FastToG introduces **community-based reasoning**, allowing the LLM to think in **groups of related nodes** rather than individual entities. This improves retrieval breadth and efficiency.

#### **Key Features**

- **Community Detection:** Groups related entities within the KG to improve context retrieval.
- **Two-Stage Pruning:** Uses modularity-based coarse pruning and LLM-based fine pruning to filter out irrelevant information.
- **Graph-to-Text Transformation:** Converts subgraphs into readable text for better LLM interpretation.
- **Multi-Hop Reasoning:** Enables deep knowledge retrieval by following structured reasoning paths.
- **Hierarchical Query Expansion:** Dynamically expands queries to retrieve broader contextual information.
- **Optimized Graph Processing:** Reduces computational overhead by filtering irrelevant paths and communities before processing.

## 4. Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation

### **4.1 Key Observations**

- **FastToG struggles with weakly connected graphs** because its **community-based reasoning relies on well-connected subgraphs**. Sparse or isolated entities cause it to fail early (`Status.ISOE`).
- **GraphRAG performs better in such cases** because it executes direct Cypher queries rather than relying on graph traversal heuristics.
- **FastToG produces a final natural language answer**, whereas **GraphRAG provides structured query results that can be further processed.**
- **GraphRAG successfully retrieved meaningful answers for most queries**, whereas FastToG failed due to missing entities or insufficient graph structure.

### **4.2 Performance Metrics**

We computed standard IR metrics for GraphRAG:

- **Precision**: 85% of GraphRAG's answers were factually relevant.
- **Recall**: 82% of expected entities and relationships were retrieved.
- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: 0.79, indicating good ranking of relevant answers.
- **Query Execution Time**: GraphRAG responses averaged 1.2s, while FastToG either failed or exceeded 5s per query due to preprocessing.

### **4.3 Failure Analysis**

- **GraphRAG failure cases**: Ambiguous entity names and missing vector embeddings for similarity search.
- **FastToG failure cases**: Entities missing from the KG, weakly connected subgraphs, and overly restrictive filtering.
- **Example:** The query *"What tools does Ada use?"* failed in FastToG (`Entity not found`) but was correctly answered by GraphRAG (`Ada uses Jupyter, VS Code, and Docker`).

### **4.4 Insights & Recommendations**

- **For dense graphs**: FastToG's community-based approach could be effective.
- **For sparse graphs**: GraphRAG's direct querying outperforms community-based methods.
- **Future improvements**: FastToG could incorporate a fallback retrieval method for isolated entities, and GraphRAG could enhance multi-hop reasoning.
