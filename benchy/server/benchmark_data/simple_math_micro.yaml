benchmark_name: "Simple Math in Python"
purpose: "Evaluate the ability of a language model to perform simple mathematical operations in Python."
base_prompt: |
  <purpose>
      Exclusively output python code that performs the requested math operation and then prints the result.
      Absolutely no additional text or explanation should be output.
      Simply evaluate {{statement}} in Python and print the resulting value.
  </purpose>

  <instructions>
      <instruction>Use Python to compute the result of the mathematical statement.</instruction>
      <instruction>Print the numeric result only.</instruction>
      <instruction>Do not output any text besides the final printed value.</instruction>
      <instruction>Ensure the output can be executed immediately for the final numeric value.</instruction>
      <instruction>Reduce decimal precision to 2 decimal places when outputting single numbers.</instruction>
  </instructions>
